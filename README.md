Blockchain101 is a Summer School course on Blockchain technology.
In this page I will make available all the slides and code.

# What you will learn
This course is an hands-on introduction to Blockchain technology.

# 1. Security Fundamental Concepts <a name="intro"></a>
---
**Class overview:**

In this class, we will present the course agenda and cover the fundamental concepts of security.
To understand what is a blockchain, one must understand the security properties and how it is possible to implement them.
In particular, we will talk about cryptography which is the core of a blockchain solution.


The students will implement mechanisms as separate modules that provide cryptographic functionalities.

# 2. Secure Distributed Systems <a name="distributed_systems"></a>
---
**Class overview:**

In this class, we will introduce distributed systems.
We will start with a motivational example of a two-person game that is a human-distributed system.
The goal is to understand the security problems of implementing such a system in practice.


The students will implement this game in software using the last class implemented modules.

# 3. Blockchain in a Nutshell <a name="blockchain"></a>
---
**Class overview:**

In this class, we finally introduce Blockchain technology: What it is? What is solves?
We will cover three types of Consensus - which is one of the problems of distributed systems:
- Byzantine Fault Tolerance (BFT);
- Proof-of-Work (PoW);
- Proof-of-Stake (PoS).
Then, we will focus on the first Blockchain that appeard: The Bitcoin.
Bitcoin address the double-spending problem.


The students will implement a PoW systems using the knowledge and code implemented in the previous classes.

# 4. Assembling the pieces: Blockchain prototype <a name="prototype"></a>
---
**Class overview:**

In this class we will put all the pieces together and build a blockchain prototype.

The prototype should have:
- Blockchain structure
- Add new blocks
- Mine blocks (PoW algorithm)

- Send blocks to other nodes
