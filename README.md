Blockchain101 is a Summer School course on Blockchain technology.
In this page I will make available all the slides and code.

# What you will learn
This course is an hands-on introduction to Blockchain technology.

## Table of contents <a name="table"></a>
1. [Security Fundamental Concepts](#intro) (3hours - TBA)
2. [Secure Distributed Systems](#distributed_systems) (3hours - TBA)

# 1. Security Fundamental Concepts <a name="intro"></a>
---
**Class overview:**

In this class, we will present the course agenda and cover the fundamental concepts of security.
To understand what is a blockchain, one must understand the security properties and how it is possible to implement them.
In particular, we will talk about cryptography which is the core of a blockchain solution.
The students will implement mechanisms as separate modules that provide cryptographic functionalities.

# 2. Secure Distributed Systems <a name="distributed_systems"></a>
---
**Class overview:**

In this class, we will introduce distributed systems.
We will start with a motivational example of a two-person game that is a human-distributed system.
The goal is to understand the security problems of implementing such a system in practice.
The students will implement this game in software using the last class implemented modules.
